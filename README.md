# POISSON-IMAGE-BLENDING
In this project we are going to implement poisson image blending and image water marking in MATLAB. The main objective of this Poisson Blending algorithm is to compose a single source image and a target image in the gradient domain. A simple cut and paste of the masked region give a bad blend since the gradients of the source do not match the gradients of the target. In this we will be using sparse Matrix and the gradient of an image than the overall intensity. We compute information about the gradient for each pixel in that part of the source image using sparse, and then apply the same gradient in the target image. The result is that each transplanted pixel on the target image has a gradient that is the same as the gradient of the corresponding pixel on the source image, but still have all the features of the source image.
